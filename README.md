# OAuth wrapper for Laravel 5

oauth-5-laravel is a simple laravel 5 service provider (wrapper) for [logical-and/php-oauth](https://github.com/logical-and/php-oauth) 
which provides oAuth support in PHP 5.4+ and is very easy to integrate with any project which requires an oAuth client.

Was first developed by [oriceon](https://github.com/oriceon/oauth-5-laravel) for Laravel 5 and I updated the composer package for the oAuth Lib.
